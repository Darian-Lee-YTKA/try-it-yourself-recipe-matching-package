# try-it-yourself-recipe-matching-package

## PART 3
Now its your turn. Download the messy code from this GitHub and make the following changes:

- Move the recipes class and list of recipes to `recipes.py`  
- Move the person class and list of people to `person.py` 
- Move the matching code to `matching_code.py` 

Create a package with all these files called `recipe_matcher`, from which the list of people, recipes and matching function can be imported

Once you have that structure, try running `using_package.py` to verify you got everything working correctly. Lets not let Nervy go hungry!
